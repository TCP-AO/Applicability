                This document discusses the properties, applicability and operational considerations
                of using TCP-AO in different network and security scenarios. It intends to provide a
                rough guide how TCP-AO can be deployed to secure TCP based protocols and applications.

<section title="Introduction">

	<t>
	This document intends to explain the properties and applicability of
	<xref target='RFC5925'>"The TCP Authentication Option"</xref> in different
	deployment scenarios and highlight the improved security the technology offers when compared
	to <xref target='RFC2385'>Protection of BGP Sessions via the TCP MD5 Signature Option"</xref>.
	It also documents recommendations for deployment.

<section title="Problem Statement of using TCP MD5 Signature">

	<t>
	The TCP MD5 Signature (TCP MD5) is a TCP option that authenticates
	TCP segments, including the TCP IPv4 pseudoheader, TCP header, and
	TCP data.  It was developed to protect BGP sessions from spoofed TCP
	segments, which could affect BGP data or the robustness of the TCP
 	connection itself [RFC2385][RFC4953].

	There have been many recent concerns about TCP MD5.  Its use of a
	simple keyed hash for authentication is problematic because there
	have been escalating attacks on the algorithm itself [Wa05].  TCP MD5
	also lacks both key-management and algorithm agility.  This document
	adds the latter, and provides a simple key coordination mechanism
	giving the ability to move from one key to another within the same
	connection.  It does not however provide for complete cryptographic
	key management to be handled in band of TCP, because TCP SYN segments
	lack sufficient remaining space to handle such a negotiation (see
 	Section 7.6).  This document obsoletes the TCP MD5 option with a more
	general TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO).  This new option supports
	the use of other, stronger hash functions, provides replay protection
	for long-lived connections and across repeated instances of a single
	connection, coordinates key changes between endpoints, and provides a
	more explicit recommendation for external key management.  The result
	is compatible with IPv6, and is fully compatible with proposed
	requirements for a replacement for TCP MD5 [Ed07].

	TCP-AO obsoletes TCP MD5, although a particular implementation may
	support both mechanisms for backward compatibility.  For a given
	connection, only one can be in use.  TCP MD5-protected connections
	cannot be migrated to TCP-AO because TCP MD5 does not support any
	changes to a connection's security algorithm once established.
	</t>

	<t>
	Today's current routing protocols were geared towards a network with an irregular
	topology and low degree of connectivity originally. When they are applied to Fat-Tree
	topologies:
